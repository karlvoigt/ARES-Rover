We moved to a new site, mainly to reduce the friction for adding documentation but we also hope it will be more user friendly. This site contains a blog as well as documentation. Some content is still to be migrated from the old site and new content (docs!) will be added soon. A positive result of this is that it is now very easy to contribute to documentation: at the bottom of all documentation pages there is a "IMPROVE THIS PAGE" link, which brings you directly to github where you can edit the markdown behind that page and issue a pull request.

Hope you like it. All feedback is welcome!
